# Basic weather App

This is a weather application built in node js.

It uses [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for it's templating.

We also tap into two Api's which are [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) for geocoding and [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/) for the actual weather forecasting.
